                <h1 class="centertitle">Official Lore of the Republic of America</h1>
                <p>Since 1776, the United States of America had been a thriving country. It was known internationally as the land of opportunity, sporting the highest per capita GDP and largest military by personnel. Since its inception, it had been governed by an iron fist. As one of the world's strongest superpowers, the US had been widespread in many military conflicts, including the infamous Korean War. For years without consequences, the leadership of North Korea had constantly raised threats against its sister nation of South Korea. The former warned of bloodshed; but no action was ever taken as they were threatened by the strong military presence of the United States on the Korean Peninsula.</p>

            <p>On October 8, 2013, Kim Jong-un, the Supreme Leader of North Korea, put his nation's army on alert and warned the United States of an impending disaster. Three days after the statement, the US sent more troops along the 38th parallel, the latitude separating North Korea and South Korea. North Korea, having seen the rapid increase in US military strength on the border, was afraid of an American invasion. Later that night, Kim Jong-un and Defense Minister Hyon Yong-chol launched a large-scale attack on the Demilitarized Zone, which separated the two nations in the hope of eliminating the US military’s ever-looming presence.</p>

        <p>On the morning of October 12, US President Barack Obama appeared on national television and declared war on the isolated and secretive nation of North Korea. President Obama requested that Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin speak with Kim Jong-un in hopes of calming the situation. After days of no response from neither China nor Russia, President Obama upgraded the DEFCON to Level 3, which put the entire US military on high alert. That same morning, Chinese and Russian leaders formed a militant strategic defense coalition and declared war on the US and South Korea. The combined military force attacked the DMZ on the 38th parallel, paralyzing the South Korean forces and completely obliterating the US forces stationed there. President Obama received word of this, immediately raised the DEFCON to Level 2, and deployed 10,000 soldiers into North Korea.</p>

    <p>On December 21, after two long months of struggle, Chinese and Russian forces seized the South Korean capital Seoul. President Putin greenlit the use of small nuclear weapons against the city, which annihilated the once bustling metropolis like a tidal wave. With the arrival of the summer of 2014, South Korea was under complete North Korean rule, as a result of the aforementioned siege of Seoul by the Strategic Defense Coalition. Massive anarchy and protests erupted, leading to the public execution of South Korean President Park Geun-hye, as well as the withdrawal of all US forces in both countries. On July 26th, 2014, President Obama flew to London to meet with Russian President Putin and Chinese President Jinping, as a token of respect and trust. Queen Elizabeth II and British Prime Minister David Cameron also attended the meeting.</p>

<p>During the conference, Prime Minister Cameron and President Obama called for an intercontinental peace treaty. The United States lost the Korean War and that would be publicly accepted. Presidents Putin and Jinping demanded that the United States would declare that Russia and China were militarily dominant and would also publicly swear allegiance to the Strategic Defense Coalition, forcing the US to act as a vassal. This greatly angered Obama, who adamantly declined and went further to discuss less violent alternatives to the peace his nation sought.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the meeting, President Putin stepped out for a moment to make a phone call. The call went to Alicia DiDonato, a citizen of the United States who defected to Russia and was employed as an intelligence agent. Putin told her that it was time to do what they had previously discussed; to bring the dismal Obama finally out of his misery. Alicia had previously been stationed by Putin on a nearby roof with a sniper rifle aimed directly at the head of the US president. Obama was shot once in the neck and once in the head. Before the Secret Service agents could even process the situation, they were shot dead by operatives of the Strategic Defense Coalition. At 11:15 a.m. EST, President Barack Obama was pronounced dead by Chinese authorities.</p>




<p>First Lady Michelle Obama and her daughters had been watching the exchange on a closed-circuit television, three buildings over, when they witnessed the murder of her husband and father of their children. By order of the Secret Service, she, her daughters, and her most senior staff were evacuated from the building and directly into a limousine which was waiting in the parking lot. A series of Chevrolet Suburban SUVs followed her as they sped off to the airport, where Air Force One was stationed. Seemingly out of nowhere, SDC operatives raided the First Lady’s motorcade, eliminating her security team, and remotely disabled her limousine. The operatives then executed her by decapitating her with a machete as her children watched through the limousine’s tinted windows, screaming and crying as they watched their mother be butchered by these savages. As Michelle’s lifeless body slumped to the floor, the chief operative attached a C4 to the roof of the limousine with the daughters inside, and said four Hail Marys before flipping the detonator switch, turning The Beast into a fireball inferno.</p>

<p>Back in the US, Vice President Joe Biden received word that the President and First Lady had been assassinated. Biden was sworn in at 2:30 p.m, just 3 hours and 15 minutes after the assassination of Barack Obama, as the 45th President of the United States of America. That evening, Congress passed a bill to place the United States under total martial law. President Biden, all Congressional affiliates and Supreme Court judges were hidden in the top-secret Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center in Virginia, in order to preserve the government. </p>

<p>On September 20th, 2014, during a meeting at the Capitol Building, President Biden was murdered along with Vice President Clinton and a great majority of the audience, after the detonation of a strategically placed C4, which was manufactured by the SDC. Immediately after the bombing, Secretary Anthony Foxx, who was the President’s designated survivor, was sworn in as the 46th President of the United States. What remained of the presidential motorcade drove him to Andrews AFB, where he boarded Air Force One and took to the skies. While Foxx was in the air, the SDC launched a massive cyber-attack against the US government that paralyzed communications and networks. Once President Foxx received word of this calamity, he ordered Codename Looking Glass to be deployed so that the U.S. Government's communications could be re-established. While the government’s electronic foundation was blacked out, SDC hackers quickly took advantage of the situation and discovered the coordinates of Air Force One, which was flying over the Atlantic Ocean at the time.</p>

<p>The Russian Air Force quickly scrambled three MiG-35 fighter jets which were en-route to Air Force One's location. At 5:19 PM Atlantic time, the Russian fighters approached the location of President Foxx’s plane and established a direct line of sight. As the aircraft’s systems had been disabled, their defenses were useless and were merely sitting ducks. The MiG-35's fired their missiles at the presidential jet, striking from behind. Hit with four missiles, Air Force One violently plummeted and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing everyone on board.

<p>News quickly broke of the accident and the entire United States unraveled into total anarchy within a mere span of a few hours. The US divulged into utter chaos and became a shell of its former self. The stock markets plummeted and a rash of riots and lootings broke out in every major city. The citizens of the once-great United States remained without leaders. After launching an assault on New York City and failing due to heavy resistance by the local populace, Russia and China realized that the United States had survived its benefits and decided to dissolve the Strategic Defense Coalition. Within one month, the armed forces of both nations returned to their homelands. With the United States in complete pandemonium and disorder, what was left of the US Chain of Command tried to regain control of situation, but ultimately failed due to the widespread of the upheaval.</p>

    <p>After that, the United States government was completely wiped out. Leading the nation were the state and local levels of the government, as most of the federal government was obliterated. Much of the United States' military resources were exhausted on the Korean Peninsula. Surrounding foreign countries tried to acquire American land just to face fierce resistance from the local civilian militia.</p>

<p>On November 26, 2014, a council was formed consisting of two men named Jonathan Cambridge and Dakota Kingsbury. Determined to rise from the ashes of tragedy, they sought to form a new nation, a nation that will emerge from the fall of America. Under a new name, altered Constitution, and many other changes, the Republic of America rose out of the ashes of the United States. The new nation was the product of years of civil wars, anarchy, and martial law. </p>
    Cambridge and Kingsbury served in the former United States government, the former as the Secret Service Assistant Director for Operations and the latter as the Deputy National Security Advisor to the President. Both men had a definitive understanding of how to lead a nation. For their third partner, Lieutenant Colonel Ellen Chamberlain served in the capacity as White House Military Office Director, meeting the two men on several occasions and becoming increasingly friendly with each. Due to the friendship, both Cambridge and Kingsbury knew that Chamberlain would make a valuable and loyal addition to the foundation of the Republic and so the men recruited her to be the Curator, a position that she was skeptical about at first, but albeit accepted later on.</p>

<p>Though reluctant, each individual state eventually agreed to join in the Republic of America. Countless changes had been made with the new government. Cambridge refined the map from 50 states to 30 states, drafted and signed a new Constitution, changed names of agencies, departments, and even reformed the structure of the military. Cambridge and Kingsbury made the executive decision to send troops to Alaska to prevents its forfeiture by local tribes, and decided to give Hawaii to the United Kingdom as a gift of solidarity and alliance.</p>

<p>In late October 2016, President Julian Williams assembled key figures of government in the Situation Room of the White House. With help from the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, President Williams devised a plan to assassinate Russian President Vladimir Putin in retaliation for the pain and devastation he had inflicted on Americans in recent years. The plan would be called “Directive Blackspear" and was highly praised by Armed Forces Commanders and the Management Board of the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>America, which had vowed revenge for the atrocities of the Russians and Chinese, launched a JSOC task force in the Khimki Forest overlooking the city of Moscow. The troupe was led by Colonel Ellen Chamberlain with the help of Captain Michael Wheeler. Under the cover of night, the task force managed to infiltrate the Red Square, which was heavily guarded by Russian security detail. The operatives quietly sent some members of the security detail and infiltrated the Moscow Kremlin under the guise of night using newly developed stealth technology. The operatives then proceeded to the entrance of the Grand Kremlin Palace, taking out guards and detail while making their way inside.</p>

<p>In the air above them was Colonel Ellen Chamberlain, squad leader and intelligence-gatherer extraordinaire. She, along with some of her most trusted subordinates, oversaw the operation as it took place. She flew in a Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, painted deep black with white accents. This was the headquarters of her detachment, and anybody who dared disobey her orders would be thrown off the plane, mid-flight. They knew if they didn’t do what was expected they’d end up in the emergency room, or worse. The Colonel ruled with an iron fist, whatever she said went. If someone tried to disobey, she wouldn’t just come after them, she’d come after their loved ones too. Ellen was promptly named "Hell's Breath" for her cunning and quick-witted remarks. In her day, she was an interrogation master, leading secret operations for American intelligence. That’s the kind of leader she was, no morals, no conscience, no compassion. She was the queen of all she surveyed and none dared question her orders.</p>

<p>On the ground, the clandestine operation was still underway. The operatives took out the ground-level guards and FSB and made their way to the personal residence of President Putin. Breaching the door and taking Putin's mistress hostage, they demanded him to get up and clothed. As the operatives had ordered, Putin dressed and surrendered. Vowing revenge, Colonel Chamberlain gave the order to neutralize the dictator. The team commander quickly removed his pistol from his jacket pocket, aimed at Putin’s mistress, and pulled the trigger twice. Two bullets hit her head in rapid succession, killing her instantly. Putin quickly whipped around to face his now-dead lover, and was greeted with four 9mm bullets; three in the chest, and one in the throat. Blood soaked into his jacket, radiating outward. He pressed snugly against his opened wounds to stop the bleeding, but to no avail. The president of Russia collapses to the floor alongside his woman, dead. Within fifteen seconds, the once-powerful dictator lay lifeless on the cold marble flooring, now stained with the color of red wine.</p>




<p>Putin lay dead before them, drenched in bullet-holes and with a helpless expression on his face. For the first time in a long time, the man who watched America burn, was dead. Gone were the days of helplessness, gone were the days of suffering. At long last Vladimir Putin had been killed, America's revenge complete. Almost losing their fifteen minute window, the operatives exited the compound and proceeded to the extraction point for immediate exfiltration. Colonel Chamberlain and her staff attentively watched the monitors of the plane and prayed that the mission would be successful.</p>

<p>The operatives were successfully evacuated via a Navy CH-53E Super Stallion. When outside of the hit-zone, Chamberlain issued orders for the immediate ICBM bombardment of the city. The RNS Stingray, which was positioned near British Hawaii, received the Colonel’s transmission and launched a total of four SLBMs aimed at Moscow. The rockets took about forty minutes to reach their destination. When the missiles hit, nothing could prevent their sheer power from devastating the city and killing millions. Now, the entire heart of Russia's government destroyed, what was left of the nation of Russia surrendered to the United Nations on December 2, 2016. In the following years, Russia regained control of its nation and established a new government in Sochi, vowing never to attack the Republic of America again.</p>

    <p>Today, in the year 2032, the Republic of America stands upright, for it remains proud and alive through the pain and unrest it endured years ago. Since the founding of the Republic of America, diplomatic relations with the Russians have increased considerably. Since that day, the Republic of America has survived the rule of more than 30 presidents, but in the end, it stood strong against all parties that threatened them and their citizens. To this day, the Republic of America is governed as a democratic republic, with Jonathan Cambridge and Dakota Kingsbury overseeing operations from the Administrative Council. As Overseer and Controller, they work hand in hand with the President and his personnel to ensure that the nation will be a thriving and prosperous Republic for years to come.</p>
