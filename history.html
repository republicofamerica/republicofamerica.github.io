        <h2>The Generation System</h2>
        <p>
          The Republic has been "restarted" several times, so much so that it is
          a common debate as to what "generation" the Republic is on. Whenever
          the Republic restarts, at the will of Disclarity or someone else, the
          generation progresses. November 2014 and the following months were the
          first generation, and the latest generation (presumably the 15th)
          started around November 21st 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the Republic restarts, the Republic must first die. Although it
          does sometimes die from inactivity, a more common death (especially
          earlier in the generations) we're the result of full scale revolutions
          from within the Republic itself. Many of which accuse founder
          Disclarity of corruption or nepotism. Many prominent members of the
          Republic have been known to participate in these revolutions.

        <h2>The Russian Mole</h2>
        <p>
          In the 6th Generation Dakota Kingsbury, then Controller of the
          Republic, gave Republic secrets to JohnathanFarrow of the Soviet Union
          in exchange for asylum. the information leaked included the existence
          of the Official Citizens Database, which was a program run by the
          Administrative Council where data was collected on every Republic
          citizen. The scope of the information is still classified to this day
          due to it's sensitive nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although pardoned by President Virginia Jackson, Dakota Kingsbury
          still receives backlack from this event to this day, and has been
          asked multiple times to be held accountable for his actions.
